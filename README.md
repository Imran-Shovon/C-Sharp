# C-Sharp

 Data Types:
1. Value Data Types
2. Reference Data Types
3. Pointer Data Type

1. Value Data Types: Value Data Types will directly store the variable value in memory and accept both signed and unsigned literals.
2. Reference Data Types: Reference Data Types will contain a memory address of variable value because the reference types wonâ€™t store the variable value directly in memory. When you create a reference type variable, such as an object or a string, you are actually storing a reference (or pointer) to the location in memory where the data is held. The actual data for reference types is stored on the heap. The heap is a large pool of memory used for dynamic memory allocation. The built-in reference types are string and object.
3. Pointer Data Type: A pointer in C# holds the memory address of a value. Pointer operations are only allowed in an unsafe context, which must be explicitly declared.
